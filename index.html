        <p>Hobby is an activity which we do to pass time with enjoyment. Basically, when we are free of our regular activities, we do something which we enjoy. This is called hobby. Hobbies are of different kinds. It depends on one’s likeness towards a hobby. People have hobbies like drawing, painting, photography and gardening etc. Every one of us likes to engage ourselves in some hobbies. Hobbies help one to remain active. Hobbies entertain us. They help people to be energetic all the time. We can get mental peace from doing the works we love. They help to add some more knowledge and skills to our past knowledge. A sport like playing football helps one to attain physical development. It develops a sense of team spirit in a person. My hobby is drawing. I love to draw with different colours. Drawing gives me happiness. My most favourite time is when I come back from school because at that time I get free time to paint.</p>
